            <p> Todays most popular VR applications involve taking total control of a users senses (sight and hearing, particularly) to create a totally immersive experience that places the user in a fully virtual environment that feels pretty realistic.Very soon, VR creators will extend this sensory hijacking to our other faculties for example, touch and smell to deepen that sense of immersion. At the same time, the devices we use to visit these virtual worlds will become cheaper and lighter, removing the friction that can currently be a barrier.
                I believe extended reality (XR)  a term that covers virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR)  will be one of the most transformative tech trends of the next five years.
                VR is already making great inroads into education, with a large number of startups and established companies offering packaged experiences and services aimed at schools. Engages platform is used by the likes of Facebook, HTC, and the European Commission to enable remote learning. And one study published in 2019 found that medical students trained using VR were able to carry out certain procedures quicker and more accurately than peers trained using traditional methods.
                The pandemic has changed many things about the way we work, including the wholesale shift to home working for large numbers of employees. This brings challenges, including the need to retain an environment that fosters cooperative activity and the building of company culture. Solutions involving VR are quickly emerging to help tackle these.
                Spatial, which creates a tool best described as a VR version of Zoom, reported a 1,000% increase in the use of its platform since March 2020. In total, the value of the market for VR business equipment is forecast to grow from $829 million in 2018 to $4.26 billion by 2023, according to research by ARtillery Intelligence.
