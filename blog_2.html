            <p> The Metaverse which was introduced by Mark Zuckerberg is about the future of digitalization. Also how humans will interact in the future in the Meta verse was all explained by Mark.
                Its actually many metaverses, or digital spaces, which typically are decentralized, incorporate augmented and virtual reality, store information on blockchain, and allow users to own digital goods. So like “the internet,” the term “the metaverse” describes a sprawling network of sites and spaces.
                Is the metaverse our future? Companies like Meta and Microsoft seem to think so, though their virtual worlds remain closed rather than the open ideal. Theres no doubt that excitement, money, and momentum are pushing us to some new form of digital reality.
