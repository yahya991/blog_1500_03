        <p>This article informs us about the development of the new Hydrogen Cell that can eventually helps the environment to reduce the harmfull emission that leads to global warming.
            The hydrogen cell can really help in the energy sector to produce the green and clean energy.This cell can be used in the transportations as fuel replacemnet and they cane really help to reduce the world problem about the emission.
            Yet there are some drawbacks about them. They can be used to make the hydrogen bombs which are much more powerfull than the atom and nuclear bombs.
