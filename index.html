            <p>The agriculture engineer at University of Illinois has developed robots that can help farmers greatly in farming. Its just like a self driving car with camera on  its sides to map the whole farm to plant things and also it can measure the height of the  plant.
                In my opinion it is really a great piece of technology but it will take the employment of the people and they might have to look for different jobs.
